# Snake Game

A simple implementation of the classic Snake game developed using Python and the Pygame library. In this game, players control a snake that moves around the screen, trying to eat food while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own body. The game provides an engaging way to practice programming with Python and understand basic game development concepts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Installation

### 1. Install Python

- Download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- Run the installer and make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH."**
- After installation, verify that Python is installed by opening your command prompt and running:

  ```bash
  python --version
  ```

### 2. Install Pygame

- Open your command prompt and run the following command to install Pygame:

  ```bash
  python -m pip install pygame
  ```

## Running the Game

1. Open your command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory where your `Snake_Game.py` file is located. Use the `cd` command:

   ```bash
   cd path\to\Snake_Game
   ```
   Replace `path\to\Snake_Game` with the actual path to your project folder.

3. Run the game by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python Snake_Game.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter a `ModuleNotFoundError` for Pygame, follow these steps:

### Check Python Version

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can check your version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

### Install Pygame

If Pygame is not installed, install it using:

```bash
python -m pip install pygame
```

### Running the Game in Visual Studio

If you are using Visual Studio, ensure that the Python interpreter is set to the one where Pygame is installed: Go to **View** > **Other Windows** > **Python Environments**. Select the correct environment. Run the game within Visual Studio.
